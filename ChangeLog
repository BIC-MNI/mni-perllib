Sun Aug  8 17:11:58 1999  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* MNI/Batch.pm (create_sync_file): take care when job_name is not
 	defined.

Sat Aug  7 16:58:16 1999  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* MNI/Batch.pm: all package variables, other than @ISA,
 	@EXPORT_OK, and %EXPORT_TAGS localised with `my'.  Option
 	identifiers changed to "lower_case_underscore_separated", the
 	style used in MNI::Spawn.

	* MNI/Batch.pm (StartJob): all parameters are optional, passed in
 	"key => value" style.  Return value changed to be the name of the
 	`start' sync file, if any; return value was previously the JobPID
 	(undocumented).

	* MNI/Batch.pm (FinishJob): new option `close_delay' used if delay
 	not given as parameter.  Return value is name of `finish' sync
 	file, if any.

	* MNI/Batch.pm (QueueCommand): QueueCommand() will call StartJob
 	and FinishJob if no job open; no longer carps about this usage.
  	If QueueCommand calls FinishJob, the name of the `finish' sync
 	file, if any, is returned.

	* MNI/Batch.pm (QueueCommands): if QueueCommands calls FinishJob,
 	the name of the `finish' sync file, if any, is returned.

	* t/batch.t: updated to account for changes to Batch.pm; no new
 	test coverage.

Fri Aug  6 18:09:11 1999  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* MNI/Spawn.pm (spawn): batch's QueueCommand option MergeErrors
 	became merge_stderr.

Tue Jul 27 19:00:42 1999  Steve ROBBINS  <stever@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>

	* MNI/Batch.pm (Synchronize): fix documentation of return value.
  	Return ref to empty array if not executing.

	* MNI/Batch.pm: Allow `JobName', `StartAfter', `MergeErrors',
 	`stdout', and `stderr' as global options.

	* MNI/Spawn.pm (spawn): change parameters for Batch::QueueCommand
 	call.

Thu Jul 22 19:52:36 1999  Steve ROBBINS  <stever@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>

	* MNI/Batch.pm (gen_batch_options, StartJob, QueueCommand): allow
 	overriding any option on a per-job basis.  Implement `StartAfter' 
	option, passed on to batch as `-a'.
	(StartJobAfter): removed function.

	* t/batch.t: bugfix (start_batchtest) and changes related to above.

	* MNI/Batch.pm (QueueCommands): compacted the code.  No semantic
 	changes made.

Tue May 18 18:36:39 1999  Steve ROBBINS  <stever@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>

	* MNI/Batch.pm (StartJobAfter): experimental batch interface using
 	'-a' option to delay a job.  This really ought to be specified
	via Batch( job, After => whatever, ... ), like the Spawn interface.

Mon May 17 16:41:18 1999  Steve ROBBINS  <stever@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>

	* t/batch.t: added simple testing of StartJob, QueueCommand,
 	QueueCommands, and FinishJob.  No testing of synchronization, yet.

	* MNI/Batch.pm (QueueCommands): StartBatchJob --> StartJob typo
 	fixed.  Expand documentation; all options documented.

Thu May 13 19:33:40 1999  Steve ROBBINS  <stever@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>

	* t/batch.t: new file.  Start of MNI::Batch regression tests.

	* MNI/Batch.pm (Synchronize): rearrange the code slightly.  Returns
	true if -noexecute.

	* MNI/Batch.pm (QueueCommands): fix bug that prevented method
	from working.

	* MNI/Batch.pm: add pod documentation.  Remove $fakeJobPID.

	* MNI/Batch.pm (sync_file_name): folded into create_sync_file().

Wed May 12 18:52:39 1999  Steve ROBBINS  <stever@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>

	* MANIFEST: add MNI/Batch.pm.

Wed May 12 18:44:49 1999  Steve ROBBINS  <stever@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>

	* ChangeLog: new file.

	* Initial import of Greg Ward's MNI perl library.  This is based
 	on the version 0.05 sources found in ~greg/src/libperl/mnilib/
	with the following removals:

	Getopt: released in own package ``Getopt::Tabular''.
	Makefile.old: built file (from Makefile.PL)
	junk: directory full of assorted test code
	log2: contains the message `junk/shred: this goes to log2'
	mni_perllib-0.05.tar.gz: tar package of code
	t/getopt.pl: symlink to Getopt::Tabular test code
