DOCS
----


CODE
----

* get (and implement!) Alex' suggestions for NumericUtilities

* proper support for redirecting to filehandles (ie. use fileno to 
  determine if it's a valid fh, and then redirect to ">&=" . fileno
  (rtfm -- the '=' might not be necessary!)

* Startup: make nocputimes and nostartdir the default (the former because
  it's often annoying, the latter because it's not often needed and greatly
  increases the module's overhead)


AUXILIARY MODULES
-----------------

* catchup on backlog of Getopt::Tabular fixes -- esp. add a 'dir' type
  (doesn't do anything to filesystem, just makes sure of a trailing slash)

* also, go over the Getopt::Tabular docs in detail for consistent style

* revamp File::Tokenize and add it to the library


BUILD PROCESS
-------------
* figure out how to add a "doc" target to main Makefile

* figure out how doc/Makefile can know the "real" perl (ie. what
  was used to run Makefile.PL) -- do I need a Makefile.PL in
  that directory too???


TESTING
-------
* datadir.t mysteriously fails on SunOS, but only when being run directly;
  when run by Test::Harness (through a pipe) it works fine.  Huh?!?!?!!?

* checkdirs.t assumes that /tmp/foo doesn't already exist -- should generate
  a unique base dir name before the check_output_path tests
